#UPDATE IN PROGRESS

Many of you have given back criticism(thank you),
there for I've been working on a version 2 of this track creator.

I'm working on these features:
  -Adding the option to individually change the size of each track piece.
  -option to generate gravel on the side of the track

What I've already done:
  -Optimising the generation/previewing of the track
  -Being more structured in the code.
  -Making an G.U.I.
  
IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, PLEASE DM ME ON DISCORD Luckyw0lf#9977

you can follow the updates in the Reworking branch,

please be patient as I'm the only developer working on this. 
And I'm doing this for fun and for the community.
